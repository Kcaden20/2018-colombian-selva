          <h3>What is Selva?</h3>
          <p>Selva is a resource talking about the history of graphic design and motifs within Colombia. This resource will focus more on Colombia's particular Indigenous and African influences. Colombia, being one of the most diverse nations, only behind Brazil, means that this influence shows up in a lot of our culture and art. Despite this, the work and design is rarely credited to the natives and africans that made the cultural objects.</p>
          <p> This mirrors the erasure of other cultures within Graphic Design, with most of the history centering on European art forms and making. This guide hopes to bring to light, the rich narrative within South American design through the lens of the country Colombia as well as a larger conversation around the legimitacy of indigenous and African design.  </p>

          <p>Finally, this guide is called Selva as a reference to the environment that Africans and Natives used to stop Erasure of their culture and traditions at the hands of Europeans, eager to mix and categorize — The Jungle.  </p>

                 An absolute cultural icon within Colombia, this item symbolizes the influence of Indigenous design in Colombian Culture. The making of the hat originated amongst the Zenú tribes located in the Sinú river region. Since the pre-Hispanic, the aborigines used the hat for sun protection during the corn crop, as evidence of an investigation in the Gold Museum in Bogotá and the Luigi Pigorini Museum in Rome. Is probably that the hat can be part of the hierarchy ritual of the tribe and it had also powerful fertilization beliefs.

                 The simple colors and repeating patterns are something that will stick throughout Colombian forms of art and design as we will see.
